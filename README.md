# Types of software design patterns

Before we describe the most common architecture patterns in Swift, you should first learn the three types of software design patterns and how they differ:
# Creational

Creational software design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. They try to instantiate objects in a manner suitable for the particular situation. Here are several creational design patterns:

    Factory Method
    Abstract Factory
    Builder
    Singleton
    Prototype

# Structural

Structural design patterns aim to simplify the design by finding an easy way of realizing relationships between classes and objects. These are some structural architecture patterns:

    Adapter
    Bridge
    Facade
    Decorator
    Composite
    Flyweight
    Proxy

# Behavioral

Behavioral design patterns identify common communication patterns between entities and implement these patterns. Behavioral design patterns include:

    Chain of Responsibility
    Template Method
    Command
    Iterator
    Mediator
    Memento
    Observer
    Strategy
    State
    Visitor

Most of these design patterns, however, are rarely used, and you’re likely to forget how they work before you even need them. So we’ve handpicked the five design patterns most frequently used in Swift to develop applications for iOS and other operating systems.
